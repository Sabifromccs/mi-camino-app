# Mi Camino App – Alpha v1.9.1

A comforting, bilingual (English/Spanish) mobile app designed to support immigrant children through legal uncertainty, emotional stress, and unfamiliar systems. Created with love and structure by Victor A. Gomez Vargas x ARKASH.

## 🧭 Mission
To provide immigrant kids—and their guardians—with a safe, friendly guide through the U.S. legal system, using simple language, comfort tools, and visual clarity. This is NOT legal advice. This is a warm guide.
